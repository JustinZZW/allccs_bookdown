It is designed to contain three major parts: 1) Unified CCS database, 2) Machine learning based CCS prediction, and 3) small molecule annotation. The unified CCS database is one of the most comprehensive CCS databases, covering ~1,700,000 small molecules. It provides a universal platform to contain both experimental CCS values (3,539) and predicted CCS values (over 10,000,000). Machine learning based CCS prediction function supports convenient prediction from SMILES structure to CCS values. This function utilizes the second generation CCS prediction algorithm to generate CCS values and RSS score for novel structures. Small molecule annotation provides an easy-to-use annotation function for various features or compounds. It is supported to search database with measured m/z and CCS for annotation, or in conjunct with any other annotation tools, such as MetFrag, CFM-ID, MS-Finder, and SIRUS etc. Zhiwei Zhou (zhouzw@sioc.ac.cn) Zheng-Jiang Zhu (jiangzhu@sioc.ac.cn) Laboratory for Mass Spectrometry and Metabolomics IRCBC, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China "],

This process is very sample, and completely private. To register an account, navigate to the home page. The “Sign up” button is in the upper right corner of the page. Then, you need to fill in your email and verification code which would be sent to your email (Figure 1.1). Finally, input some basic information to complete the registration. You could log in and enjoy all functions in the web server. Figure 1.1: Register AllCCS account 1.2 Browser CCS database You could search you interested compound (name, formula, smiles, inchi, InChIKey etc.) in the search box in navigation bar, or directly browser the all database records in the “browser” page (Figure 1.2). Figure 1.2: Register AllCCS account Then, you can click the link in the column of AllCCS ID to browser detail information of this compound (Figure 1.3). It includes basic meta information, unified CCS values, experimental CCS records, predicted CCS records and other database links etc. Please see section 2 for more details. Figure 1.3: Register AllCCS account 1.3 Perform CCS prediction/Annotation AllCCS also provides CCS prediction function (Section 3) and metabolite annotation functions (Section 4). You could click the link or corresponding item in navigation bar. For CCS prediction function, please input the SMILES list of your compounds in the input panel. The result would be returned on the project panel within several seconds (Figure 1.4). Figure 1.4: Register AllCCS account For annotation function, you could search experimental feature to search the database with your settings, or filter/rerank candidates to conjunct with MS/MS annotation tools (Figure 1.5).
