It is designed to contain three major parts: 1) Unified CCS database, 2) Machine learning based CCS prediction, and 3) small molecule annotation. The unified CCS database is one of the most comprehensive CCS databases, covering ~1,700,000 small molecules. It provides a universal platform to contain both experimental CCS values (3,539) and predicted CCS values (over 10,000,000). Machine learning based CCS prediction function supports convenient prediction from SMILES structure to CCS values. This function utilizes the second generation CCS prediction algorithm to generate CCS values and RSS score for novel structures. Small molecule annotation provides an easy-to-use annotation function for various features or compounds. It is supported to search database with measured m/z and CCS for annotation, or in conjunct with any other annotation tools, such as MetFrag, CFM-ID, MS-Finder, and SIRUS etc. Zhiwei Zhou, Zhengjiang Zhu IRCBC, Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry Chinese Academy of Sciences zhouzw@sioc.ac.cn Copyright (c) 2019 AllCCS Development Team "],

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter ??. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2018) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). References "],
