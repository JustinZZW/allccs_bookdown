# Metabolite Annotation{#chapter4}

<p style=text-align:justify>The part provides an easy-to-use annotation function for unknown features or compounds. It consists of two functions in this part. One is feature match, which supports searching database with measured m/z and CCS for annotation. The second function is candidate rank, which can be in conjunct with any other annotation tools, such as MetFrag, CFM-ID, MS-Finder, and SIRIUS etc. With the results from previously mentioned tools, and inputting experimental m/z and experimental CCS, users can filter/re-rank candidates for more accurate annotation.</p>

## Feature to candidates (Feature match){#chapter4d1}

<p style=text-align:justify>Feature match function provides a simple and straightforward way to annotate features with experimental m/z and CCS in the AllCCS database. There are several annotation conditions set in this part (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d1)).</p>

```{r figure4d1, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Feature annotation'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/chapter4/figure4.1.png', dpi = NA)
```

- **m/z**: Experimental m/z of your interested peaks.
- **CCS**: Experimental CCS of your interested peaks.
- **m/z tolerance (±)**: The tolerance between experimental m/z and theoretical m/z in database. Users can choose ppm or Dalton as unit.
- **CCS tolerance (±)**: The tolerance between experimental CCS and theoretical CCS in database. Users can choose percentage or Å2 as unit.
-	**Adduct**: Match with the checked adduct forms that exist in the database.
- **Type**: Match with the checked CCS type in the database, including Experimental CCS, Predicted CCS (See Section \@ref(chapter2d1)).
- **Database**: Match with the checked database. It includes 8 compound structure sources (See Section \@ref(chapter2d1)).

<p style=text-align:justify>The match results are as follows (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d2)). The results contain brief information for each compound as section 2.1 Compound Browser mentioned. </p>

<p style=text-align:justify>Users can check the interested compounds in the last column. Click the download option, you could download a CSV table containing the information of you checked compounds (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d2)). </p>

**Note**: 

- Download function supports up to 100 items for one time.

## Complement to MS/MS result (Candidate rank){#chapter4d2}

<p style=text-align:justify>The candidate rank function supports filtering/re-rank candidates with inputted candidate list. This function could be in conjunct with any other in-silico MS/MS tools like MetFrag, CFM-ID, MS-Finder, and SIRIUS etc. Specifically, it has two rank types: **CCS filtering** and **CCS scoring**. CCS filtering excludes candidates which CCS errors (comparing with predicted CCS values) beyond the pre-defined cutoff value. CCS scoring generates an integrated score for each candidate with custom weights of CCS score (The detail is some with our previous publication - LipidIMMS Analyzer [@reference9]) and MS/MS score. With CCS filtering or scoring, it can provide more credible results.</p>

### Data preparation{#chapter4d2d1}
<p style=text-align:justify>The MS/MS results (CSV file) generated from other tools should be modified as specific format. A demo data is showed in Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d3). It should include 7 columns with specific names (“rank”, “name”, “smiles”, “inchikey”, “adduct”, “score”). The definitions of each column are given as follows:</p>

```{r figure4d3, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Candidate rank function'}
knitr::include_graphics('images/chapter4/figure4.3candidate_rank.png', dpi = NA)
```


- **rank**: The first column in the CSV table. It is the score rank from other tools (e.g. MetFrag, CFM-ID, MS-FINDER, SIRIUS etc).
- **name**: The second column in the CSV table. Compound names of candidates.
- **smiles**: The third column in the CSV table. SMILES structures of candidates.
- **inchikey**: The fourth column in the CSV table. InChIKey identifier of candidates.
- **adduct**: The fifth column in the CSV table. Adduct form of candidates. Please note that it only supports 7 common adducts (Positive mode, [M+H]+, [M+Na]+, [M+NH4]+, [M-H2O+H]+; Negative mode, [M-H]-, [M+Na-2H]-, [M+HCOO]-).
- **score**: The sixth column in the CSV table. The MS/MS match score generated in in-silico MS/MS tools.

**Note**:

- The inputted CSV file should have the same column name with demo data.
- The column order should be keep same with demo data.


### Parameter setting {#chapter4d2d2}
<p style=text-align:justify>In the candidates rank function, users can get more reliable results by adjusting parameters according to their experiments. The candidate rank function contains parameters as follows:</p>

- **Measured m/z**: Experimental m/z of corresponding feature.
- **Measured CCS**: Experimental CCS of corresponding feature.
- **Candidate list**: A CSV file of candidate (See Section \@ref(chapter4d2d1)).
- **Rank type**: It consists of CCS filtering and CCS scoring. When choosing CCS filtering, the next option is CCS tolerance (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d3)). It will filter the results that out of the pre-defined CCS tolerance. If you choose CCS scoring, the follow options are showed as Figure Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d4). It consists of Minimum tolerance, Maximum tolerance, CCS weight, and MS/MS weight.
- **CCS tolerance (±)**: This parameter is available in CCS filtering. The tolerance between experimental CCS and theoretical CCS in database. Users can choose percentage or Å2 as unit.
- **Minimum tolerance (%)**: This parameter is available in CCS scoring. If error is within the tolerance, CCS match score equals to 1. Range: 0-10.
- **Maximum tolerance (%)**: This parameter is available in CCS scoring. If error is larger than the tolerance, CCS match score equals to 0, and lipid candidates will be removed. Range: 0-20.
- **CCS weight**: This parameter is available in CCS scoring. The CCS match score weight to calculate integrated score.
- **MS/MS weight**: This parameter is available in CCS scoring. The MS/MS match score weight to calculate integrated score.

<p style=text-align:justify>Users can also click download to obtain CSV table which contains the same information as preview results (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d5)).</p>

```{r figure4d5, fig.align='center', echo = FALSE, fig.cap='CCS filtering result of candidates'}

```


#### CCS scoring{#chapter4d2d3d2}
<p style=text-align:justify>The results generated with CCS scoring function are similar with results from CCS filtering (Figure \@ref(fig:figure4d6)). The difference is that CCS scoring has two additional columns as CCS score and integrated score.</p>

- **CCS score**: CCS score generated by comparing experimental CCS to predicted CCS values. CCS match is scored using a trapezoidal function. (The detail of trapezoidal function LipidIMMS Analyzer [@reference9])
- **Integrated score**: The integrated score is calculated using a linear weighting function according to the user-defined weight for each match score.
